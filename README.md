# Steam-Download-Shutdown
Shuts Down Computer after all ongoing steam downloads are completed.


# The Problem.
If you are like me you do not like to leave your computer on and running overnight, I try the make sure that it is off to make sure that it stays healthy and running well for as
long as possible. I also enjoy playing games and prefer to install games overnight while I sleep so I do not have to worry about waiting on them. This problem helps to give you 
the best of both worlds. Just run this program, start your downloads and let the program do the rest. 

# Features
- Automatic Finding of the Steam Process.
- Shuts down after 15 minutes of download being complete (Can be changed.)
- If computer loses internet connection, program will detect it and wait until connection returns.

# Usage
1. Open steam DO NOT START DOWNLOAD
2. Run this program (Countdown will start but you have 15 minutes to start download or stop program)
3. Queue your downloads on steam.
4. Go to bed and sleep easy. (Sweet dreams.)
